# WindowsDefualtServicesChecker
Windows Default Services Checker is a program for comparing the default services of **_Windows 10 Home_** and **_Windows 10 Pro_** with your machine, the purpose of this process is to know what you did after installing **_Windows_**.
## How it works??
- It relays on a mdb file that contains the default Windows process.
- The program imports the process from the mdb file alnogside with your machine services and puts them in a different datagridviews.
- Then you can compare the process by clicking on **_Compare button_** and the program will compare the two lists of process and shows you the difference and a new window titled with **_New Process_**.
- Then you can click the **_Export to CSV_** to export the process into a CSV file.
- You can also click on the **_Forbidden Button_** if you hate Capitalisme systems.
## What you need to run the program??
1. The mdb file which you will find it attached with the project in a folder named **_The mdb file that you need_**.
2. If the program had another error which i wish it doesn't you will need to install **_MetroFramework_** from **_NuGet Package Manager_**.
3. If you did all of this and the program didn't run successfully contact us at **_WLDDTeam[at]protonmail[dot]ch_** to solve your problem and give us free feedback.
